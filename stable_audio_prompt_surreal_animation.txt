================================================================================

PRIMARY PROMPT (RECOMMENDED):

Electronic psychedelic vaporwave | Hypnotic swirling synthesizers with kaleidoscopic arpeggios | Lush analog synth pads, modular synth sequences, glitchy textures, ethereal vocal chops, sub bass | Surreal, dreamlike, trippy, mesmerizing, otherworldly | 110 BPM | Y2K digital aesthetics, vaporwave movement, SOPHIE-influenced | Studio-quality, wide stereo image, reverb-drenched, prismatic production, immersive spatial design

================================================================================

NEGATIVE PROMPT:

acoustic instruments, guitars, drums, rock elements, organic sounds, minimal production, lo-fi, muddy mix, harsh distortion, aggressive tones, silence, abrupt ending, generic EDM, cheesy presets

================================================================================

PARAMETER RECOMMENDATIONS:

- Duration: 12 seconds (exact)
- Variations: 3-4 generations to find best visual sync
- Seed strategy: Random first, then fixed seed for variations
- Post-processing: Manual fade-out in final 1-2 seconds for loop potential

================================================================================

ALTERNATIVE PROMPTS:

OPTION 2 - MORE AMBIENT/ATMOSPHERIC:
Ambient psychedelic soundscape | Evolving textural layers with cosmic resonance | Granular synthesis, reverb-soaked pads, crystalline bells, processed vocals, deep sub frequencies | Ethereal, surreal, floating, hypnotic | 90 BPM | Space ambient, Brian Eno-inspired, vapor aesthetic | Immersive, studio-quality, expansive stereo field

OPTION 3 - MORE GLITCH/EXPERIMENTAL:
Experimental glitch electronica | Fragmented modular synthesis with morphing timbres | Circuit-bent synths, bit-crushed arpeggios, glitch percussion, warped samples, filter sweeps | Psychedelic, abstract, uncanny, digital surrealism | 120 BPM | Autechre-influenced, IDM, glitch art aesthetic | Pristine digital production, crystalline clarity, spatial movement

================================================================================

AUDIO-VISUAL SYNC NOTES:

Visual Elements → Sonic Translation:
- Golden cubic voxels → Kaleidoscopic arpeggios, crystalline tones
- Swirling cyan/magenta patterns → Hypnotic synthesizer sweeps
- Purple grid platforms → Modular synth sequences, structured rhythm
- Stone sculpture head → Ethereal vocal chops, processed vocals
- Green glass tubes → Glitchy textures, prismatic effects
- Dynamic camera movement → Spatial stereo design, evolving layers

Quality Score: 9/10

The primary prompt balances hypnotic vaporwave aesthetic with rhythmic energy to match your dynamic camera movement and maximalist composition.
