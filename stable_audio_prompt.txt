[Intro - Synth Rise & Vocal Chop]
yeah—
uh
turn it up

[Verse 1 - Trap Rap]
Click-clack, camera flash, we don’t miss  
Run the board, every move calculated  
Big bass hit when I step in the frame  
Too fast, they can’t even say my name  

Radar locked, yeah I’m on that lane  
Drip so sharp, cut through champagne  
Talk cheap, but my sound heavyweight  
Countdown tickin’, watch me detonate  

[Verse 2 - Trap Rap]
808 talk, let it shake the floor  
All eyes on me when I hit that door  
Too bold, too cold, no rehearsal

Chain reaction when I breathe that fire  
One line, whole room go higher  
No pause, no fear, full ignition  
This that global transmission  

[Pre-Chorus - R&B]
Pull me closer, slow it down  
Heartbeat under the sound  
When you whisper my name like that  
I forget where the edges are  

Lights go low, voices melt  
Every note just how I felt  
Hold your breath, let it bloom  
Something ’bout to break real soon  

[Chorus - Pop Explosion]
Boom, boom, feel it in your chest  
When the beat drop, we the best  
Hands up high, don’t overthink  
Say my name, make the whole world blink  

Flash, flash, colors collide  
We don’t wait, we ignite  
Round and round, stuck in your brain  
This that hook you won’t escape  

[Post-Chorus - Chant]
Hey!  
Turn it l
